The Summary of my project:
I got the idea for making a smart light back in September.

Before I bought any parts, I spent time modeling the whole project step by step, using Tinkercad.

I pre-planned how the circuit would look, where each wire would go, and how everything would connect.

This planning helped me understand the project fully even before touching the real components.

So when the parts finally arrived, I didn’t waste time figuring things out, because i already had the previous planned circult in tinkercad.

I already knew what to do, so I finished building it and finished it way before the expected deadline.

After putting it together, I connected it to Alexa, so now the light can be turned on or off using voice commands.

The system works smoothly because the planning was strong from the beginning.

Basically: good planning made the project simple, fast, and successful.

Even though it's a smart home device, the idea and setup were easy to manage because everything was prepared beforehand.

Components:
Servo Motor:1
ESP8266 Module:1
Wires:10M/F, 10F/F, 10M/M

Total cost:₹1500 + GST
